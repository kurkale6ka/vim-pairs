Use "" instead of ci" or ci' or ci`
===================================

A plugin which makes it possible to use "" (2 double quotes)
in place of ci" or ci' or ci`

You don't even have to be on the line you're interested in. The first screen  
line containing a pair of quotes will be used (a top screen line will be used if  
there are no quotes below the cursor).  
In a line containing pairs of both type of quotes, the first quote left to the  
cursor will be used to decide.
